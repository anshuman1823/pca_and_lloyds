Instructions to run the code:

1. All the source code for all the algortihms and functions are kept in separate .py files. All these .py files should be maintained in the same directory.

2. The "main_file.py" file is the main file containing code to carry out all the tasks given in the 
assignment. Therefore, you only need to run this "main_file.py" file. It will automatically import all the other necessary functions.

3. Keep the datasets inside a folder named "datasets". This folder should
be in the same directory as that of all the other .py files.
